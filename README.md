18. Consider this scenario: A customer wants to re-order her favourite foundation
product,   but she doesn't   remember which shade she ordered last   time.   In   the   past,   she   probably   had to log onto the cosmetics website and   hunt through   her   order history to find such   information. Today, she can simply ask   a   bot:   "What   shade   of foundation did   I order last?" The   bot can then   quickly   match   her   identity, find   her order history, understand which   product she's referring to,   and   tell   her.

SECTION B: 
SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS 
Refer to the   Exam Case at the end of this   booklet to   answer ALL questions   in   this   section.
21. A typical SmartCare Smart Apartment   installation process is described   below:
The   installation   process begins when a customer order comes through   requesting for   a smart apartment   installation. The receiver then processes the   order   by   sending through a purchase order for the   required   parts.
Once the   parts   have   been   received, the   next available technician will be assigned to   the   job.
The technician then visits the customer’s home to assess   and   decide   on   the
appropriate locations for the sensors   installations. This   is then followed   by   the
installation and configuration of these sensors with the associated components. The      technician will then   monitor to   make sure that all associated parts   of the smart   home   are functioning as is, triggering when needed and   are   reporting   valid   measurements.
If there are   no   problems detected, the technician will   proceed to sign-off.   If there are   problems detected, the technician will investigate the potential   causes   of the problems and communicate the next course of action   to   the   customer.If the customer is happy with the technician’s recommendation,   the   technician   will   proceed to fix the problem. Otherwise, the technician will   reschedule another visit   with better recommendations and   log the job as   incomplete.As part of fixing the problem, the technician will also   identify   if additional   components      are required.   If other components are needed, the technician will   proceed   to   order the   parts, followed by rescheduling another home visit with   the   customer.   If   no   additional      parts are required, the technician will proceed   to fix   the   problem.
After the   problem   has   been   resolved, the technician will send a bill to the   client’s   account and log the job as   complete.
a.       Model the Smart Apartment   installation process outlined   above with   a   process   diagram.    (10   marks)
b.       Link TWO different specific information systems   and   TWO   departments   to   the   appropriate steps outlined in the   above   process.(4   marks)
22. Consider the eCare   Dashboard from the case.
●          Identify ONE example of “Transactional” and “Analytical”   information   that   can   be   generated from the use of the eCare   Dashboard.
●          Identify   FOUR examples of data   inputs for each type of information   generated   above.
●         Suggest what   insight SmartCare could gain from the information   in   order to   generate value for its retirement village and/or   its   residents.    (8   marks)
23.   IoT ecosystems   bring about a   number   of potential   risks.   In   particular, the   issues
surrounding the security of SmartCare residents data, where an   overabundance   of   data that are being collected, shared   and   stored   online.
a.       Looking   back to the case,   identify one such specific   potential   risk.
b.       Referring to the four major risk   management   responses   covered   in   class,   outline   the actions that SmartCare could take for each of these   responses   in order   to deal with this potential   risk.    (8   marks)
24. Consider this scenario: With the immensely positive   outcomes   seen   in the   current
operation, SmartCare has decided to further invest   in   establishing   another smart retirement village.   Honour Moses   has   been appointed as the   project   manager to oversee the   project. She   has   been allocated a budget of $200   million   and   a   timeline   of 24   months for the   new   retirement village. With careful   planning,   Honour is confident that this   project   is achievable.   However, shortly after the start of the   project,   Honour was told   by   her manager that   her timeline   is   being   reduced to   18   months. 
Discuss the   impact of this decision on the   project   in terms of the project   management   triangle with justifications for your answer.    (8   marks)
25. For each of the categories of value below,   provide   an   example   of   how   SmartCare’s   use of IS/IT generates value for   itself or   its   customers.
●          Reduce Cycle Time
●          Reduce Costs
●          Increase Customer Satisfaction
For each example,   provide:
● a specific   key   performance   indicator (KPI) to   measure that value; and
● a benchmark, which ‘SmartCare’ could compare the   KPI against.    (12   marks)
Exam Case: SmartCare - The Modern Retirement Village 
Adapted from: https://mapleknoll.org/technology/
As technology becomes an increasingly essential   part of our   everyday   lives,   SmartCare,   a luxurious continuing care retirement community,   is   leveraging   it   to   help   keep   residents   in their communities feeling safe, stimulated and healthy.   SmartCare   knows that retirement looks different to boomers than   previous generations,   so they   are   working   to   create an innovative continuum of care environment where   residents   can   age   more independently.
Each resident in the retirement village   is   equipped with   a wearable   device.   This   device collects critical data from the residents, including   glucose   levels,   body temperature,   food      intake, sleep   habits,   bathroom   habits, daily steps, location and   heart   rate. Such   data   is               then delivered to a central database.    Caregivers   can then   track   the   residents’   health   and   spot any changes in behaviour,   by accessing   “eCare”,   a   single   dashboard   app.   On eCare, all caregivers can conveniently access reports   about   the   whole   picture   of   each   resident’s   health. These data and reports are also   updated   and   delivered   to   their appointed   physicians   in   real-time.   Data collected and updated   in this   manner   can assist      in generating timely   health alerts, which can speed up the   detection   of   health   issues   and   aid the physicians’ and caregivers’ decision-making. This   is   also shown   to   reduce   the costs of unnecessary or prolonged hospitalisation or   long-term   care.
Late last year, SmartCare decided to partner   with   Tower Technologies   to   incorporate more useful technologies to improve the well-being of their residents.   Tower   specialises   in managing solutions such as data centre   infrastructure,   cybersecurity,   data   analytics and   IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystems. Together, SmartCare and Tower   created   a Knowledge and Service (KS) lab, catered   to   SmartCare   residents, where   they   access online and on-site classes on how they   can   use technologies, for   example, Amazon’s               Alexa virtual assistant   device,   Uber rides and Whole   Foods   Market (to   order   groceries).      They can also learn more about   smart   home   technology   and   obtain   recommendations            from   in-house staff to find   new ways to integrate devices into their   daily   lives.   Residents   can then arrange to have new devices   and   technological   services   set   up   in   their   homes. 
For example,   in a “Smart Apartment” at SmartCare, the   IoT system   is   linked with   sensors   placed throughout the   home.   If a   resident gets out of bed   in the   middle of the   night,   lights   on the floor will come   on, to reduce the   risk of falling and   highlight   potential   hazards.
Blinds can   be set up to automatically adjust,   as   can   lights   and   even   appliances.   Smoke      detectors, motion sensors, doorway sensors and   more are   all   carefully   selected with   the   expert   input from the Tower team, and are linked to the   IoT   system.   The   metrics generated from these sensors are also delivered to eCare,   giving   caregivers   a   better   picture of their residents’ well-being. 
The ultimate goal of this   new technology   is to   help residents   live   healthier,   happier   lives in a setting they feel most comfortable with. SmartCare   believes   that   this   could significantly   improve the residents’ quality of life while reducing   an   increasing   cost   on   the   health-care system. The   KS lab is part   of their   effort   to   stay   ahead   of this   problem, with   a   dedicated space where new concepts and prototypes   of sensors   and   systems   can   come   to   life.
